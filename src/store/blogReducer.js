        content: 
        `Chadwick Boseman's character in Black Panther will not be recast with a new 
        actor for the blockbuster's sequel, Marvel Studios has confirmed.
        Boseman led the hit 2018 film as T'Challa, the king of Wakanda, before his 
        death in August at the age of 43.\n
        Marvel boss Kevin Feige said Boseman's performance was "iconic and 
        transcends any iteration of the character in any other medium from Marvel's 
        past".\n
        "And it's for that reason that we will not recast the character," he said.\n

        Black Panther, which made $1.3bn (Â£1bn) at the global box office, was the first 
        superhero movie to be nominated for best picture at the Oscars.\n

        "To honour the legacy that Chad helped us build, we want to continue to
        explore the world of Wakanda and all the rich and varied characters 
        introduced in the first film," Feige said.\n

        Director Ryan Coogler, who made the original, is already "hard at work" on the 
        follow-up, which is due for release in July 2022, Feige added.
        There had been speculation that film-makers would use a digital double for 
        Boseman in the sequel, but that has previously been denied by executive 
        producer Victoria Alonso.\n
        
        The actor died four years after being diagnosed with colon cancer.
        He is tipped to win a posthumous Oscar for playing a headstrong trumpeter in 
        his final film, Ma Rainey's Black Bottom, which was recently released in 
        cinemas and is out on Netflix next week.`
